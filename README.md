# LifeOS Documentation Platform

> My vision for a revolutionary web application that enables you to create comprehensive, hierarchical documentation of your life - serving as both a personal planning tool and professional portfolio platform.

## üåü Why I Built This

I started this because I was tired of having my life scattered across different apps and platforms. I'd built this comprehensive documentation system for my own life - organizing everything from academic work to creative projects - and it completely changed how I think about my goals and progress.

The thing is, we treat our code projects with way more organizational rigor than we treat our own lives. We have detailed README files, structured directories, and comprehensive documentation for our software, but when it comes to personal and professional development, most of us are just winging it with scattered notes everywhere.

But here's what got me really excited: after building my own system, I realized how cool it would be if other people had this too. Not just for organization, but so we could actually see how other people organize their minds, what they're working on, and potentially connect and collaborate on projects. Like, imagine being able to browse through someone's documented interests and experiences and thinking "oh, this person would be perfect to work with on X project" or "they've already figured out something I'm trying to learn."

## üéØ The Problems This Solves

So here's what I was dealing with, and I think a lot of people have similar issues:

Your stuff is everywhere - resume in Google Docs, project notes in Notion, academic work scattered across folders, creative projects just living in your head. It's impossible to see the big picture of what you're actually working toward.

Plus, if you want to create a decent portfolio or personal site, you either need to learn to code or settle for some generic template that doesn't really capture your story.

But the thing that really got to me was how isolated this whole process is. Like, I might be struggling with something that someone else has already figured out, or I might have experience that could help someone else, but there's no way to discover these connections. We're all just doing solo development on the most important project of our lives.

And then there's this weird split where tools are either for personal planning OR for showing off your work, but never both. So you end up maintaining two separate systems that drift apart, and you miss chances to connect with people who might be interested in what you're doing.

## üí° What I'm Building

So I'm making a browser-based tool that fixes these issues. You can create hierarchical documentation of your life - Academic, Professional, Creative, whatever domains matter to you. You edit everything directly in the browser with markdown support, so no coding required, but you still get the power and flexibility of proper documentation.

The cool part is that you organize everything in nested sections and subsections, just like you would organize a complex software project. But here's the key: the same system you use for personal planning can become your public profile, so you can connect with others, collaborate on shared goals, and work on projects together.

I'm thinking about stuff like documenting your learning journey in public, finding people who are working on similar things, discovering collaborators for projects that align with your interests, or offering help to others based on your experience. Basically "Plan-In-The-Open" - where your life documentation becomes a way to find your people and work on cool stuff together.

## üöÄ Inspiration: My Personal Site

This project is inspired by my own comprehensive life documentation system - a space-themed portfolio that demonstrates the power of treating your life like a well-documented project. When I built my personal site, I organized everything into six major life domains: Academic, Operational, Professional, Service, Creative, and Open Letters. Each domain contains detailed documentation of institutions, experiences, skills, and projects.

What started as a way to organize my own thoughts became something much more powerful. The site serves as both my personal planning tool and my professional portfolio. When I'm making decisions about my career or education, I can see the full picture of where I've been and where I want to go. When someone wants to understand my background, they get a comprehensive view rather than just a traditional resume.

The technical implementation includes custom animations, interactive elements, and a carefully organized file structure - but the real magic is in how it transforms scattered life experiences into a coherent narrative. My personal site proves the concept; this app makes it accessible to you and everyone else who doesn't want to spend months learning web development just to organize their life properly.

## üéØ Who This Is For

I built this thinking about conversations I've had with friends who feel like they have all this potential but can't quite organize or present it well. Maybe you're someone who's accomplished a lot but struggles to show it coherently, or you're a student trying to figure out how your academic work connects to your career goals and wishing you had mentors or peers to learn from.

Or maybe you're a freelancer juggling multiple domains and losing track of your own growth, or someone changing careers who needs to tell a compelling story about diverse experiences while connecting with others who've made similar transitions.

I've talked to academics who have research scattered everywhere and wish they could find collaborators more easily, entrepreneurs who can't effectively communicate their varied skill sets, and creative people whose portfolios don't capture the full scope of what they do.

The common thread is that everyone has more value to offer than they can effectively organize and present, and most people are doing this work in isolation when they could benefit from community and collaboration.

This is for you if you want to take control of how you organize and present your life's work while opening up possibilities for meaningful connections. Whether you're planning your next move, showing others what you're capable of, or looking to collaborate with like-minded people.

## üöÄ How You Can Get Started

### What You'll Need
- Modern Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) for full File System API support

### Quick Start for You
**Option 1: Try it immediately**
- Visit [rivirside.github.io/LifeOS](https://rivirside.github.io/LifeOS) and start using it right now!

**Option 2: Run it locally**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Choose your approach:
   - **Create New Project**: Select an empty folder or create a new one - the app will populate it with template sections and pages to get you started
   - **Load Existing Project**: Import your existing markdown files from a folder

**Important**: When you create or load a project, you'll need to grant the app permission to read and write files in your selected folder. This uses the browser's File System Access API to save your work directly to your computer.

### If You Want to Develop
```bash
# Serve locally (optional)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx http-server

# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## ü§ù How You Can Contribute

I'm actively developing this project and would love your help! Building something that truly serves people's needs requires diverse perspectives and experiences. Maybe you've struggled with the same organizational challenges I'm trying to solve, or maybe you have ideas for features that would make this tool more powerful.

If you're a designer, I'd love your help creating better user experiences that make complex life documentation feel intuitive and even enjoyable. If you're a developer, there are tons of features to build and browsers to support - I'm trying to maintain a lightweight, framework-free approach while still delivering powerful functionality.

I'm also looking for people to help create templates for different use cases. What would a LifeOS look like for a researcher versus an artist versus an entrepreneur? How do we make it easy for someone to get started without having to design their entire organizational system from scratch?

The most valuable contribution might be simply using the tool and telling me what works and what doesn't. I want this to solve real problems for real people, which means I need to hear from people who are actually trying to organize and present their lives more effectively.
